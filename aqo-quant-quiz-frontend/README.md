# Aqo Quant — Quiz Competition (Frontend)

This is a frontend demo of the Aqo Quant quiz competition (DSA & Aptitude) built with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS. It is a static frontend with localStorage-based leaderboard and sample quizzes.

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

1. Open PowerShell and change to the project folder:

```powershell
cd "C:/Users/bhask/OneDrive/Desktop/PROJECT - FULL STACK/aqo-quant-quiz-frontend"
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

4. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:

- This is a frontend-only demo. Results are stored in the browser's `localStorage` and used to populate the leaderboard.
- To add quizzes, edit `src/data/quizzes.js`.

If you want I can add user registration, persistence (backend), or more quizzes/components next.
